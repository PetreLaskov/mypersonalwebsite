# About

This is a space for contemplative writing, visual art, and thoughtful exploration of ideas that matter.

## Philosophy

Following principles of slow, intentional content creation, everything here is designed to last and to invite genuine reflection. This approach prioritizes:

- **Timeless Over Timely** - Content designed to remain relevant and valuable over years, not just days
- **Depth Over Breadth** - Thorough exploration of fewer topics rather than surface coverage of many  
- **Quality Over Quantity** - Careful craft and thoughtful revision rather than rapid publication
- **Reader Value** - Focus on genuine utility and insight rather than engagement metrics

## Technical Approach

Built with Jekyll for GitHub Pages, following principles of:

- **Sustainable web development** - minimal dependencies, fast loading
- **Progressive enhancement** - works without JavaScript, better with it
- **Accessibility first** - semantic markup, keyboard navigation, screen reader support
- **Privacy by design** - no external tracking, minimal data collection
