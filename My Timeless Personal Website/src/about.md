# About

This is a personal space for contemplative writing, visual art, and guided meditation practices.

Following the tradition of thinkers like Gwern Branwen, this site aims to be:

- **Timeless**: Content that remains relevant over years
- **Deep**: Substantial exploration of ideas rather than quick takes  
- **Accessible**: Clear writing that welcomes all readers
- **Minimal**: Clean design that focuses attention on content

## Technical Notes

This site is built with:

- **Pandoc** for markdown processing
- **Semantic HTML5** with no frameworks
- **Progressive enhancement** for accessibility
- **Dark mode** support
- **Fast loading** with minimal dependencies

The source code follows Gwern's principles of transparency and reproducibility.
