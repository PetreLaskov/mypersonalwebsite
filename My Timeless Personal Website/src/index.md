# Welcome

This homepage content is dynamically generated from the YAML frontmatter above. The template system allows for rich, structured content while maintaining the simplicity and elegance of the design.

## Philosophy

This site represents an experiment in creating lasting, meaningful content for the web. Drawing inspiration from thinkers like Gwern Branwen, it prioritizes:

- **Long-term thinking** over immediate reactions
- **Substantial exploration** over quick takes
- **Thoughtful craft** over rapid iteration
- **Reader value** over engagement metrics

The technical approach mirrors these values: semantic HTML, progressive enhancement, no tracking, and a focus on accessibility and performance.

## Technical Notes

Built with Pandoc for content processing, following principles of:

- **Sustainable web development** - minimal dependencies, fast loading
- **Progressive enhancement** - works without JavaScript, better with it
- **Accessibility first** - semantic markup, keyboard navigation, screen reader support
- **Privacy by design** - no external tracking, minimal data collection

The source code is available for those interested in the technical implementation.
