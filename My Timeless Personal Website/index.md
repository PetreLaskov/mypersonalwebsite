## Philosophy

This site represents an experiment in creating lasting, meaningful content for the web. Drawing inspiration from thinkers like Gwern Branwen, it prioritizes:

- **Long-term thinking** over immediate reactions
- **Substantial exploration** over quick takes
- **Thoughtful craft** over rapid iteration
- **Reader value** over engagement metrics

The technical approach mirrors these values: semantic HTML, progressive enhancement, no tracking, and a focus on accessibility and performance.
